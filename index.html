</p>

  <h2>Preparation time</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>liTotal: Approximately 10 minutes</li>
  <li>Preparation: 5 minutes</li>
  <li>Cooking: 5 minutes</li>
</ul>
 <h2> Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2-3 large eggs</li>
  <li>Salt, to taste</li>
  <li>Pepper, to taste</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon of butter or oil</li>
  <li>Optional fillings: cheese, diced vegetables, cooked meats, herbs</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
  
  <li> <b>Beat the eggs:</b> In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are <br> well mixed. 
  You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</li>

 <li> <b>Heat the pan:</b> Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>

  <li><b>Cook the omelette:</b> Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the <br>pan to ensure 
  the eggs evenly coat the surface.</li>

   <li><b>Add fillings (optional):</b> When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly <br>runny in the 
  middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>

   <li><b>Fold and serve:</b> As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it <br>over the 
  fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</li>

  <li> <b>Enjoy:</b> Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
